# ActiveInferencePy

Port of https://github.com/AnnaCSales/ActiveInference to Python.

The code is an implementation of https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006267, to model the activity of the Locus Coeruleus as a measure of the ‘state-action’ prediction error in an Active Inference framework.

This will be extended to incorporate extentions to the modelling in learning tasks.
